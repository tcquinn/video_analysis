Okay, here's a breakdown of the student's interaction and some recommendations for the teacher:

**Analysis of Student Interaction**

*   **Initial Confidence:** The student correctly plots point L' in the first step, showing an initial grasp of the basic concept of dilation.
*   **Struggling with Calculation and Application:** The student initially struggles with plotting point M', indicating a lack of understanding of the scale factor, or how to apply it on the grid.
*   **Seeking Boost:** After failing to place M', the student receives a "boost" that breaks down the problem into smaller steps.
*   **Formulaic Input:** While the student fills out the horizontal and vertical distances from P to M, they struggle with where to put this number: they put '3' in the original measurement, not the dilated measurement, and do this again when they complete all steps.
*   **Engagement:** The student appears to be trying and is engaging with the material, though initially frustrated. The reliance on prompts and step-by-step guidance suggests that the student is trying, but lacking the independent skills.
*   **Mastery:** Appears to grasp basic arithmetic facts, however struggling with the bigger mathematical picture of dilation.

**Recommendations for the Teacher**

1.  **Address the misunderstanding of Formula Application:** Instead of merely correcting errors, discuss *why* we use the scale factor to calculate the distances. Guide the student through the logic that dilation multiplies each distance from the center of dilation.

2.  **Visual/Hands-On Reinforcement:**
    *   **Use Manipulatives (if possible):** Have the student physically stretch a shape (perhaps on a rubber band or with a projector) to visually demonstrate the scaling effect. Use string and rulers to physically measure the distances.
    *   **Overlay Technique:** Print a transparent overlay of the original grid onto another grid with dilated axes, allowing the student to align the center of dilation and visually map the dilated points.

3.  **Strategic Questioning:**
    *   Instead of stating facts, ask questions to prompt deeper thinking:
        *   "What does it mean for the scale factor to be 2?"
        *   "If the distance from P to M is 3 units, and we double that distance, what does that new distance represent?"
        *   "How does doubling the distance change the position of the point on the graph?"

4.  **Focus on Conceptual Understanding Before Procedural Fluency:**
    *   Before diving into problems like this, spend more time on activities to solidify the definition and concept of dilation. Draw shapes on balloon and stretch it, measuring the change in edges.
    *   Revisit fundamental definitions and properties to foster a deeper understanding.

5.  **Encourage Self-Checking:** After each step (plotting a point, filling in a value), have the student pause and ask themselves: "Does this make sense in the context of dilation?" "Is my new shape larger/smaller as expected?"

6.  **Provide Gradual Release of Responsibility:**
    *   Start with simpler examples and easier dilation factors (e.g., scale factor of 1.5, 3, etc).
    *   Provide partially worked examples where the student needs to complete a few steps and then independently work their way through.

7.  **Address the Root Cause:** The error wasn't arithmetic, it was placing the numbers into the correct category. Address the fact that we are multiplying distances, not vertices.

8. **Follow up on point M' and N':** Don't assume the student will be able to apply this to later points just because they finished M'. Make sure to keep asking questions and checking understanding as they progress.

By combining these strategies, the teacher can move beyond simply correcting errors and help the student build a solid conceptual foundation for dilation.
