**Summary of Understanding:**

This student struggles a lot at first with the general format of equations.  They seem to struggle with the abstract idea of an equation at first.  They also have some trouble remembering and connecting the visual to an equation. They were able to successfully write the equation, show their work, and then finish solving it. The student would benefit from further instruction on how equations work.  The student seems very capable, but may need assistance on the topic for this lesson.
