Okay, here's the analysis of the student's work in the video, focusing on the skills used, success, and possible misconceptions revealed.

**Overall Summary**

The student understands basic equation balancing principles (performing the same operation on both sides). However, they struggle with the initial translation of the hanger diagram into an algebraic equation.  The student also experiences problems when working with the Zeam learning software.

**Recommendations**

*   **Focus on translating diagrams to equations:** More practice with different scenarios translating real-world situations (like these hanger diagrams) into accurate algebraic equations is needed. Use simpler diagrams first.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
