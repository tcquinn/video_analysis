Okay, this is a great example of how scaffolding can help a student pinpoint their error and succeed!

## (1) Table of Student Moves

| Timestamp | Student Move/Action | Skill Needed | Successful? | What this tells us |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0:04 - 0:20 | Drags blue dot to plot L'. Counts 1 right, 1 up from P to L, then goes 2 right, 2 up from P to place L'. | 1. Identify center of dilation (P). 2. Determine vector from P to L. 3. Multiply vector components by scale factor (2). 4. Apply new vector from P to plot L'. | Yes | Student understands the basic process of dilation for the first point or can visually/countingly execute it. |
| 0:21 | Clicks "Enter". | Confirming action. | Yes ("Nice!") |  |
| 0:23 | Clicks "Next". | Proceeding to next step. | Yes |  |
| 0:27 - 0:33 | Attempts to plot M'. Drags blue dot. P to M is (3 right, 5 down). Student plots M' at roughly (3 right, 7 down) from P. | 1. Identify P. 2. Determine vector from P to M. 3. Multiply vector components by scale factor (2). 4. Apply new vector from P to plot M'. | No | Error in applying scale factor, counting, or both. The x-component seems unscaled, y-component is incorrectly scaled/counted. |
| 0:34 | Clicks "Enter". | Confirming action. | No ("Try again") |  |
| 0:40 - 0:49 | Attempts to plot M' again. Drags blue dot. Student plots M' at roughly (4 right, 8 down) from P. | Same as above. | No | Still making an error. The x-component is slightly off, y-component is closer but still incorrect (should be 6 right, 10 down from P). |
| 0:50 | Clicks "Enter". | Confirming action. | No ("That's not it", "Here's a boost!") | System provides scaffolding. |
| 0:53 | Clicks to dismiss "Here's a boost!". | Acknowledging hint. | Yes |  |

| 1:14 - 1:23 | Enters "5" for "units down" (Distance from P to M). | Counting vertical distance on grid. | Yes | Student can correctly identify the vertical component of the vector from P to M. |
| 1:25 | Clicks "Enter". | Confirming input. | Yes ("Nice!") |  |

| 1:44 | Clicks "Enter". | Confirming input. | No ("Try again" - but this seems like an interface issue; the *input* was correct, the system wanted the *products* next, but the text "Record the scale factor" was still active). The student correctly identified the scale factor. | The system expected the scale factor to be filled in for *both* equations simultaneously before hitting enter, or it was a misclick. However, the student correctly input '2' for the scale factor. |

| 2:00 - 2:01 | Enters "6" for (3 * 2 = __ units right). | Multiplication (3x2). | Yes | Student can correctly calculate the scaled horizontal distance. |

## (2) Summary of Understanding and Misconceptions

**Understanding:**
*   The student demonstrated an initial understanding of how to dilate the first point (L to L') correctly, implying they grasp the concept of scaling distances from a center of dilation.
*   Through the scaffolding, the student showed they can:
    *   Accurately determine the horizontal and vertical distances from the center of dilation (P) to a pre-image point (M).
    *   Identify and recall the correct scale factor (2).
    *   Correctly multiply the original distances by the scale factor to find the new distances.
    *   Plot a point accurately when given explicit, pre-calculated scaled distances and a visual guide.

**Misconceptions/Areas for More Help:**
*   **Integrating Multiple Steps:** The primary difficulty arose when trying to plot M' *without* the step-by-step scaffolding. The student struggled to:
    1.  Correctly determine the vector from P to M.
    2.  Mentally (or visually) multiply *both* components of this vector by the scale factor.
    3.  Accurately count out these *new, scaled* distances from P to plot M'.
    The errors made in the initial attempts to plot M' (e.g., 3 right, 7 down; then 4 right, 8 down) suggest a breakdown in one or more of these integrated steps. It wasn't a simple case of forgetting the scale factor entirely, but rather misapplying it or miscounting, especially when dealing with larger coordinate changes.
*   **Systematic Application:** The student might benefit from a more systematic approach when performing dilations without scaffolding, such as:
    *   Explicitly writing down the coordinates of P and M.
    *   Calculating the vector PM (change in x, change in y).
    *   Multiplying both components of vector PM by the scale factor.
    *   Adding this new scaled vector to the coordinates of P to find the coordinates of M', or carefully counting out the scaled components from P.

**Conclusion:**
The student understands the individual components of dilation. The scaffolding was effective in breaking down the process and helping them arrive at the correct answer for M'. The main challenge lies in independently and accurately executing all the steps of dilation for a point simultaneously, especially when the distances involved are larger. More practice in applying the full process without intermediate checks might be beneficial, encouraging them to perhaps jot down intermediate calculations (the vector P to M, then the scaled vector P to M') before plotting.
