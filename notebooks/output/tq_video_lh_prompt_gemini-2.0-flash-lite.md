| 0:24-0:34  | Selects the correct point for dilation | Understanding dilation and scale factor | No          |  Possibly not considering the scale factor correctly.     |
| 0:35-0:40  | Selects the wrong point for dilation      | Understanding dilation and scale factor | No          |  May need a review of how dilation expands or contracts the shape. |
| 0:41-0:47  | Selects the wrong point for dilation      | Understanding dilation and scale factor | No           |  Possibly confused about using point P as the reference point for the dilation. |
| 0:48-0:50 | Selects the correct point                 | Understanding dilation and scale factor | No         |   Likely not accounting for scale factor and distance.      |
| 0:51-0:57 | Displays a hint prompt  |  None                 |             |   None        |
| 1:00-1:14  | Enters 3 in the right column | Measuring from Point P.    | Yes        | Correct understanding of right unit from M to P.      |
| 1:15-1:26  | Enters 5 in the down column. | Measuring from Point P.       | Yes         | Correct understanding of down unit from M to P.       |
| 1:27-1:29  | Displays a prompt that informs them of the scale factor, 2. | None         |           | Shows student is missing something in the calculation.         |
| 1:30-1:34  | Fills in the 6 value                 | Multiplying             | Yes           | They multiply correctly from M to P units.       |
| 1:35-1:44  | Enters the wrong value                 | Multiplying             | No           | They do not account for the scale factor correctly from P to M.       |
| 1:45-1:58  | Displays a prompt that informs them of the new values. |  None         |           |   None                                         |
| 1:59-2:15  | Calculates and plots                 |  Multiplying correctly.       | Yes         | Correct understanding of the formula.                 |

## Summary of Student Understanding and Needs

**Strengths:**
*   Understands the concept of dilation and how it changes the size of a figure.
*   Can identify the coordinates of points on a grid.
*   Can measure the right and down units of the original point.
*   Understands that the scale factor will effect the outcome.
*   Understands how to complete a multiplication problem.

**Challenges and Potential Misconceptions:**

*   *Misunderstanding Scale Factor Application:* The student struggles with correctly applying the scale factor to determine the new location of the dilated point *M*.
*   *Overlooking Reference Point:* The student may not fully grasp that the dilation is relative to the point *P* or the formula for dilating.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Reinforce Dilations:** Provide additional problems.
2.  **Visual Representation:** Use visuals.
3.  **Step-by-step Instructions:** Review the individual components.
4.  **Formula and Practice:** Emphasize the formula.
