| 1. Writes `37` in the first text box.                 | Representing a value from a diagram.     | No          | The student initially fails to recognize that the prompt asks for the equation that the hanger diagram represents. They write 37 as a single element, not a full equation.                                                 |

| 4. Enter value "37" on one side of the equation             | None                                     | yes         | The student understands one side of the equation needs to be represented first.                                                                                                                            |
| 5. Places "5z" on other side of equation                        | Understanding variables, math terms  | yes          | Student is now accurately reading the hanger diagram and understanding that to create the equation, they need to represent all components of both sides of the "Hanger".                                 |
| 6. Enters "2" as added term to "5z"                           | Recognizing the constant on that side.  | yes          | Understands the added constant is important in balancing the equation.                                                                                                                           |
| 7. Subtracting 6 from each side                          | Application of Subtraction         | No          | Student does not understand that we would like to isolate g which we can do by subtracting 6 from each side.          |
| 8. Enter value "37 = 5z + 2"                                           | Writing an algebraic equation, observation | yes          | The student is now accurately reading the hanger diagram and understanding that to create the equation, they need to represent all components of both sides of the "Hanger".          |
| 9. Enters "2" on either side to balance.                          | Balancing the equations                          | Yes          | the student is correctly balancing the equation.                         |
| 10. Enter value "35 = 5z -2"                                          | Balancing the equations                          | NO          | the student is incorrectly balancing the equation.                           |
| 11. removes -2 from the equation             | Balancing the equations                          | Yes         |  the student is balancing the equation but is removing values that are in the question.            |
| 12. Correctly dividing, then solving      | none                                     | Yes         |                                                  |

**Summary of Understanding and Misconceptions**

*   **Equation Writing:** The student requires step by step instructions of reading a diagram and understanding how to form equations from hanger diagrams.
*   **Balancing equations:** The student appears to learn how to balance the equation once they get some hints from the AI and follow the steps involved.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Focus on Writing an equation from a diagram:** Explicitly teach the student how to understand the questions and then follow the prompts.
*   **Balancing equations** It could be helpful to have the student work through additional examples.
