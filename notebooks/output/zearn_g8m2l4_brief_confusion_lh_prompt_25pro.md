**(2) Summary of Understanding and Misconceptions**

*   **Understanding:**
    *   The student successfully dilated the first point (L') without assistance, indicating a basic grasp of the concept or procedure initially.
    *   The student can accurately determine the horizontal and vertical distances between two points on a grid (vector components from P to M).
    *   The student knows how to multiply these distances by the scale factor to find the new distances for the image point.
    *   When explicitly told the final horizontal and vertical distances from the center of dilation, the student can correctly plot the image point.

*   **Misconceptions/Areas for Help:**
    *   **Generalizing the Procedure:** The student struggled to independently apply the dilation process to the second point (M) after succeeding with the first (L). This suggests the procedure wasn't fully internalized or generalized. They might have gotten lucky with L' or found its simpler vector (2, -1) easier to scale than M's (3, -5).
    *   **Center of Dilation:** The initial incorrect placements of M' strongly suggest the student might have been measuring the distance from M itself, rather than from the center of dilation P. This is a common error – forgetting that dilation scales distances *from the center*.
    *   **Integrating Steps:** While the student could perform each *individual* step when prompted by the scaffolding (find vector PM, multiply by scale factor, plot from P using result), they struggled to put these steps together *unprompted* to find M' initially.

*   **What's Next:**
    *   The student clearly benefited from the step-by-step breakdown.
    *   They need more practice integrating the full process: (1) Identify the vector from the center to the original point, (2) Multiply that vector by the scale factor, (3) Apply the *new* vector starting from the center to plot the image point.
    *   Explicit reinforcement that all measurements and scaling must originate from the center of dilation (P) is crucial. Practice problems with different centers of dilation and scale factors would be beneficial.
