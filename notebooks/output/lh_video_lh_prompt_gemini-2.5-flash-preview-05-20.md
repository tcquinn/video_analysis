Indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of what an "equation" is (i.e., two equal expressions) versus just an expression.                                                                         |

Incorrect operation: Used subtraction (`-`) instead of addition (`+`). <br>2. Incorrect coefficient: Represented 5 'z's as `z` instead of `5z`.                                                                                                                                  |

| 2:11      | Selects "Subtract 24..."       | **Solve Equation:** Choose first balanced move to isolate the variable term.    | No       | **Misconception:** Attempted to isolate the variable `2g` by operating on the constant `24` on the *other side*. This indicates a lack of understanding of the order of operations for isolating a variable (undoing addition/subtraction *before* multiplication/division, and doing it to the constant term on the *variable's side*). |

This is a simplification error after the balanced move.                                                                                                    |

## (2) Summary of Student Understanding and Misconceptions

The student demonstrates a **developing understanding of linear equations and their solutions** using hanger diagrams.

**Initial Misconceptions & Growth:**

1.  **Equation Definition:** The student initially struggled with the basic definition of an equation, omitting the equal sign and not correctly representing the terms on the right side of the hanger diagram. This is a foundational issue in equation formulation.
2.  **Representing Variable Terms:** The student initially represented "5 groups of z" simply as "z," indicating a lack of understanding of coefficients in algebraic expressions.
3.  **Strategic Solving (Isolating the Variable Term):** The most significant misconception observed was the attempt to subtract 24 from the equation `24 = 2g + 6`. This shows a lack of a clear strategy for isolating the variable term. Instead of performing the inverse operation on the constant term *on the variable's side* (subtracting 6 from both sides), the student attempted to operate on the constant on the *other side*. This suggests they might not fully grasp the concept of "undoing" operations to isolate the variable in the correct order.
4.  **Simplification After Balanced Moves:** There was one instance where the student correctly identified the balanced move but then failed to simplify the resulting expression correctly (e.g., `5z + 2 - 2` becoming `5z - 2`). However, they quickly self-corrected this when prompted, which suggests it might have been a minor oversight.

**Strengths and Areas of Understanding:**

*   **Learning from Guided Practice:** The student showed strong ability to learn from the "boost" (guided practice) feature. After receiving specific instruction, they successfully applied the correct methods to subsequent problems and even to the repeated first problem. This is a very positive indicator.
*   **Applying Balanced Moves:** Once guided on *which* operation to perform, the student consistently applied balanced moves correctly (e.g., subtracting or dividing the same value from both sides).
*   **Self-Correction:** The student demonstrated the ability to self-correct a simplification error, which is a valuable problem-solving skill.
*   **Linking Diagram to Equation:** By the end of the session, the student consistently and correctly translated the hanger diagram into a linear equation.

**Recommendations for Further Help:**

1.  **Reinforce Equation Structure and Terminology:** Briefly review the definition of an equation (expressions on both sides joined by an equal sign) and the meaning of coefficients (e.g., `5z` means `z + z + z + z + z`). Visual aids like hanger diagrams are excellent for this, but explicitly connecting the visual to the algebraic notation could be beneficial.
2.  **Strategy for Solving Multi-Step Equations:** Focus on the process of isolating the variable term first. Emphasize that to isolate `5z` in `37 = 5z + 2`, one must "undo" the addition of 2 by subtracting 2 from *both sides*. Using the analogy of "unwrapping" the variable (like peeling layers off an onion, or PEMDAS in reverse) can be helpful.
3.  **Practice with Simplification:** Include some quick practice problems that require simplifying expressions after balanced moves to ensure the student consistently cancels out inverse operations (e.g., `5z + 2 - 2` simplifies to `5z`).

Overall, the student shows strong potential given their ability to learn quickly from feedback. The initial struggles highlight common points of confusion in setting up and beginning to solve linear equations, but these seem to be addressed effectively by the platform's guided boosts.
