**(2) Summary of Understanding and Misconceptions**

*   **Understanding:**
    *   The student understands that the hanger diagram represents a balanced equation where the left side equals the right side.
    *   The student knows to use an equals sign (=) in an equation.
    *   The student understands that solving an equation involves isolating the variable.
    *   The student understands the properties of equality: whatever operation is done to one side must also be done to the other (demonstrated with subtraction and division).
    *   The student can perform the necessary arithmetic (subtraction, division).
    *   **Crucially, the student shows the ability to learn from scaffolding and transfer that learning to new, similar problems.** This is seen when they correctly write the `2g + 6` equation after help with `5z + 2`, and when they correctly identify subtracting 2 as the first step for the 'z' problem after help with the 'g' problem.

*   **Misconceptions / Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Initial Equation Representation:** The student initially struggled significantly to translate the visual hanger diagram into a correct algebraic equation, particularly representing multiple instances of a variable (the coefficient) and the constant term correctly. This required scaffolding.
    *   **Identifying First Solving Step:** The student initially made an error in identifying the *first* step to solve a two-step equation (tried subtracting 24 instead of 6 in `24 = 2g + 6`). They needed scaffolding to focus on isolating the variable *term* first by dealing with the constant.
    *   **Simplifying Expressions:** The student showed a specific bug when simplifying `5z + 2 - 2`, initially writing `5z - 2` instead of `5z`. This indicates a potential misunderstanding of how inverse operations cancel each other out (zero pairs).

*   **Overall:** The student demonstrates foundational understanding but has specific procedural bugs related to translating visuals to algebra, identifying the first solving step, and simplifying after applying an operation. However, their ability to correct errors after feedback and transfer learning from scaffolded examples is a positive sign. They would likely benefit from more practice specifically focusing on:
    1.  Writing equations from various visual models (hangers, tape diagrams, word problems).
    2.  Explicitly discussing the order of operations for *solving* two-step equations (undo addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division).
    3.  Practicing simplifying expressions after an operation has been applied to both sides, focusing on zero pairs and identity elements.
