Okay, let's break down this student's interaction with the Zearn lesson.

**How is the student interacting with the lesson?**
*   The student is persistent and works through the problems despite making several errors. They don't give up easily.
*   They rely heavily on the system's feedback ("Try again," "That's not it") and the scaffolding provided ("Here's a boost!").
*   When presented with multiple-choice options or drag-and-drop for steps, they are more successful.
*   They appear to learn from the immediate scaffolding for *that specific step or problem type*, as seen when they correctly set up the equation for the 'g' variable after being walked through the 'z' variable equation.

**What concepts and procedures does the student appear to have mastered?**
*   **Identifying parts of the hanger:** They can identify the total on one side (e.g., 37, 24).
*   **Representing multiplication:** After scaffolding, they understand that "5 groups of z" is "5z".
*   **Arithmetic:** They can perform the basic arithmetic (e.g., 37 - 2 = 35; 35 / 5 = 7) once the operation is clear.
*   **Following guided steps:** When the system breaks down the problem into smaller, explicit steps (e.g., "Start with the left side," "Now look at the right side," choosing an operation), they can follow along successfully.
*   **Applying a just-learned procedure:** They correctly wrote the equation `24 = 2g + 6` after being scaffolded through `37 = 5z + 2`, showing some transfer.

**What concepts and procedures does the student struggle with?**
1.  **Translating the visual hanger diagram into a complete symbolic equation independently:**
    *   Initially, they wrote "37" instead of a full equation (0:19).
    *   Then, "37 = z - 2" (0:40), misinterpreting the relationship between the 'z' blocks and the '2' block and the operation.
    *   Then "37 = z" (0:58), oversimplifying the right side.
    *   *Nature of misunderstanding:* Difficulty seeing the right side of the hanger as a sum of two distinct terms (a variable term and a constant term) and representing that with correct operations.
2.  **Identifying the correct first algebraic step to isolate the variable term in a two-step equation:**
    *   For `24 = 2g + 6`, they initially chose "Subtract 24 from each side" (2:13) instead of addressing the "+ 6".
    *   *Nature of misunderstanding:* Uncertainty about the order of operations for solving (SADMEP - undoing addition/subtraction before multiplication/division to isolate the variable term). They might be focused on the number on the other side of the equals sign or trying to eliminate the variable term itself.
3.  **Correctly simplifying after an operation:**
    *   When simplifying `5z + 2 - 2`, they initially wrote `5z - 2` (3:19) before correcting it to `5z`.
    *   *Nature of misunderstanding:* A minor procedural slip, possibly rushing or not fully tracking the cancellation.

**What appears to be their state of engagement and understanding by the end of this interaction?**
*   **Engagement:** Still engaged, as they completed the entire "Tower of Power."
*   **Understanding:** They can successfully navigate the problem *with the system's tight scaffolding and by breaking it into discrete steps*. Their understanding seems more procedural at this stage. Whether they could solve a similar problem from scratch on paper without any prompts or multiple-choice options is questionable, especially the initial equation setup and identifying the first strategic move.

**Given all of the above, what should the teacher do to help accelerate this student's learning?**

1.  **Reinforce Equation Writing from Visuals (Hanger Diagrams):**
    *   **Explicit Instruction & Modeling:** Use physical or digital manipulatives (like algebra tiles alongside hanger diagrams). Model thinking aloud: "On this side, I see a block of 37. So that's '37'. This hanger is balanced, so that means 'equals'. On the other side, I see five 'z' blocks, so that's '5 times z' or '5z'. I *also* see a '2' block on that same side, so we're adding it to the 5z. The equation is 37 = 5z + 2."
    *   **Targeted Practice:** Provide several hanger diagrams and have the student *only* write the equation. Focus on correctly identifying the terms and the operations connecting them. Start with simpler one-step hangers if necessary and build up.
    *   **Error Analysis:** If they make a mistake writing the equation, ask them to point to the part of the hanger their term/operation represents.

2.  **Solidify the Strategy for Solving Two-Step Equations:**
    *   **"Unwrapping the Variable":** Use the analogy of unwrapping a present or reversing steps. "To find out what 'z' is, we need to get it by itself. What operations are happening to 'z'? It's being multiplied by 5, and then 2 is being added. To unwrap it, we undo those operations in reverse order."
    *   **Isolate the Variable Term First:** Explicitly teach that the first goal is to get the term *containing* the variable (e.g., "5z" or "2g") alone. Ask: "What is on the same side as the 5z but *not* part of it? The '+2'. How do we undo adding 2?"
    *   **Why that Step?:** After they (or the system) identify a step (e.g., "subtract 2 from both sides"), ask "Why is that a good first step? What will that help us achieve?" (Answer: It gets the '5z' term closer to being alone).
    *   **Card Sort/Matching:** Create cards with equations and cards with "first step" descriptions (e.g., "subtract 6 from both sides"). Have the student match them.

3.  **Connect to Prior Knowledge (Order of Operations):**
    *   Remind them of PEMDAS for evaluating expressions. Explain that for *solving* equations, we generally go in reverse order (SADMEP) to isolate the variable.

4.  **Small Group Instruction or 1-on-1 Check-in:**
    *   Work through 2-3 similar problems with the student, providing less scaffolding each time. Observe their thinking process.
    *   Have them verbalize their steps and reasoning. This will reveal more about their conceptual understanding versus procedural recall.

5.  **Monitor for Simplification Errors:**
    *   The `5z + 2 - 2 = 5z - 2` error was minor but worth noting. Encourage careful checking after each step. "What does '+2 - 2' simplify to?"

By focusing on the initial translation from visual to symbolic and the strategic first moves in solving, the teacher can help build a stronger conceptual foundation, which will make the procedural steps more meaningful and less prone to error.
