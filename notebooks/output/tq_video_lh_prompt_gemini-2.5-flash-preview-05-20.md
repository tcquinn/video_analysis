Here's a breakdown of the student's actions and understanding:

### (1) Analysis Table

| Timestamp Range | Student Action / Input | Skill Needed | Success (Y/N/Partial) | Misconception/Bug Revealed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0:06 - 0:21 | Plots L' | Calculate and apply dilation with scale factor 2 from point P(1,9) to point L(3,7). (L is 2 right, 2 down from P. L' should be 4 right, 4 down from P -> (5,5)) | Y | None evident. Student accurately plotted L'. |
| 0:28 - 0:35 | First attempt to plot M' | Calculate and apply dilation with scale factor 2 from point P(1,9) to point M(4,4). (M is 3 right, 5 down from P. M' should be 6 right, 10 down from P -> (7,-1)) | N | Plotted M' at (4,2). This point is 3 units right, 7 units down from P. Indicates misunderstanding of how to apply the scale factor (e.g., confused the scale factor with the actual units or miscalculated the target coordinates). |
| 0:36 - 0:54 | Subsequent attempts to plot M' | Same as above. | N | Continues to try different incorrect points through trial and error. This reinforces the initial misunderstanding of the dilation process for M or struggles with coordinating (x,y) with movements from P. |
| 1:13 - 1:24 | Enters distances from P to M | Determine horizontal and vertical distances between two given points on a grid. | Y | None. Accurately identified 3 units right and 5 units down. |
| 1:39 - 1:44 | Enters scale factor and result for M' equations (initial) | Multiply original distances by the scale factor (3*2=6, 5*2=10). | N (Platform bug) | Student correctly entered the scale factor (2) and the resulting scaled distances (6 and 10). However, the system incorrectly marked this as "Try again". This is a significant platform bug that likely confused the student. |
| 1:48 - 1:56 | Enters scale factor and result for M' equations (subsequent) | Same as above. | N | After the incorrect feedback, the student engaged in trial-and-error, inputting incorrect numbers (e.g., swapping values, putting the scale factor into the result boxes). This reveals confusion stemming from the initial incorrect feedback and possibly a lack of independent confidence in the calculation. |
| 1:56 - 2:05 | Enters scale factor and result for M' equations (final) | Same as above. | Y | None. Student successfully entered the correct scale factors and results. |
| 2:10 - 2:13 | Plots M' based on calculated distances | Plot a point on a grid given horizontal and vertical displacements from a reference point. | Y | None. Successfully plotted M' at (7,-1) based on the calculated displacements (6 right, 10 down). |

### (2) Summary of Student's Understanding and Misconceptions

The student demonstrates a **partial understanding** of dilation, with specific strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
*   **Calculating distances:** The student can accurately determine the horizontal and vertical distances between two points on a grid (e.g., from point P to point M).
*   **Plotting points from displacement:** Given a clear instruction of horizontal and vertical displacements from a reference point, the student can accurately plot the final point (e.g., plotting M' after the boost).
*   **Conceptual understanding of scale factor:** The initial successful dilation of L' suggests an intuitive grasp, or at least a working method, for applying the scale factor in simpler cases. They also correctly input the scale factor into the equations, eventually.

**Misconceptions/Areas for More Help:**
*   **Applying the scale factor to coordinates/displacements:** The primary struggle is in the initial attempt to plot M' (0:28-0:54). While they can calculate initial distances, they failed to correctly apply the scale factor to those distances to find the new coordinates for M'. This suggests they might not fully internalize the rule: *new displacement = original displacement Ã— scale factor*.
*   **Reliance on guided steps:** The student performed well when the problem was broken down into explicit steps (calculating initial distances, then applying the scale factor, then plotting). This indicates they can follow instructions but may need more practice to independently execute the full dilation process without scaffolding.
*   **Impact of incorrect feedback:** The significant confusion and trial-and-error observed after the platform incorrectly marked a correct answer (1:39-1:44) severely hindered the assessment of their true understanding. This suggests that without reliable feedback, they might lack the confidence to stick with a correct approach or identify their own errors.

**Recommendations for Additional Help:**
*   **Reinforce the "multiply the displacement" rule:** Provide more practice problems where students explicitly calculate the horizontal and vertical distances from the center of dilation, then multiply *those distances* by the scale factor, and *then* use these new scaled distances to find the image coordinates.
*   **Practice with varying scale factors and directions:** Include dilations with different scale factors (e.g., 0.5, 3) and cases where the center of dilation is not (0,0) and the points are in different quadrants.
*   **Self-checking strategies:** Encourage students to verbally or mentally walk through their steps and verify calculations. This can help build confidence and reduce reliance on trial-and-error, especially when system feedback is ambiguous.
*   **Focus on the process, not just the answer:** Emphasize understanding *why* each step is taken in a dilation, rather than just getting the correct final point.
